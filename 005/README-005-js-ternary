Ternary operators are operators which are used to check for conditions and manipulate data like in conditinal statements
Ternary operators exist in various other programming languages,
like in C:-

a>b?a=1:b=1;

Or like in Python:-

 print ("Both a and b are equal" if a == b else "a is greater than b"
        if a > b else "b is greater than a")

Ternary operators are used to shorten the lines of code for simple conditional statements
