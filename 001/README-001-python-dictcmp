In Python, we are familiar with the concept of list comprehension, which has the power of assigning values in a list with the use of conditional statements inside the list.
To declare a normal list, we need atleast 3 lines of code, whereas list comprehension requires only one line to initialize values in the list.
The syntax for list comprehension:-
list_name = [iterator for iterator in sequence if condition]

Similarly, dictionary comprehension's syntax is:
dict_name = {key:value for key,value in sqeuence if condition}

Advantages:-
    Fewer Lines of code
    Time and space efficient
    Filtering is easier
Disadvantages:-
    If the condition in which the elements of the list is complex, then the code becomes unreadable
    Eg: another_list = [(i*7 + 5) % 13 if i%2==0 else (i*5 + 7) % 23 for i in range(k) ]
