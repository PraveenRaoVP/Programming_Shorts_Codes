LEGB stands for Local, Enclosed, Global, Built-in Scope
These are scope resolutions which play an important role in accessibility of variables, methods etc.

Eg.
a=10
def foo():
    b=1

Here a is a global variable, and b is a local variable.

Eg.
from math import pi
pi=3.14

Here pi from the math module comes under built-in scope, whereas pi=3.14 comes under global variable

Enclosed, or nonlocal scope is an enhanced version of global which is used in nested structures, which gets its value from the parent function.
